# Muse
 
This Repo conatains a minimal implementation of Google's Muse. I only implement the first stage and use my own pretrained Clip model (you can find [here](https://github.com/K3dA2/Clip))

Here are some sample images:

prompt: 1girl, black_hair, blue_eyes

prompt: 1girl, purple_hair

### Note:
- Artifacts on the image are from the ViT model. Its an issue I noticed when I train on smaller models. I'm currnetly training a larger model so hopefully I'll replace the images here with the ones from the larger better model
